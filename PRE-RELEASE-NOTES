Jacksum 3.7.0, TBD, 2023

- new algorithms:
  - n/a

- new features:
  - added option --string-list to calculate hash values from strings stored in text files
    - added options --string-list-charset, and alias --charset-string-list
    - added options --ignore-empty-lines
    - added formatter alias #MESSAGE for #FILENAME
  - added password mode, and readline mode for -q
    - added charset-console, and alias --console-charset
  - added type oct for -q

- improved performance:
  - performance for algorithm info output (-a <algos> [--list] --info)

- updated documentation:
  - added description and encoding tables for the most common encodings (see "jacksum -h -E")

- bug fixes:
  - NPE if filename is null and -F is set (e.g. 'jacksum -a none -F "#SEQUENCE" -q txt:')
  - NPE can occur if both -a none and -E has been set
  - #FILENAME is not replaced in <format> if both "-F <format>" and "-q file:<file>" have been used
  - aliases blake2sp-256 and blake2bp-512 are not accessible
  - regression: "jacksum -a all:blake -l" returns "blake2sp-256 is an unknown algorithm" due to missing alias
