Jacksum 3.1.0, TBD

- new features:

    - allow Jacksum to read from all Windows files types on Microsoft Windows including
      disks, partitions, RAM disks, the nul-device, and NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) on both files and directories
    - allow Jacksum to read from all file types on Unix-like operating systems including
      block devices, character devices, named pipes (FIFOs), sockets, and doors (Solaris only)
    - added option called --scan-ntfs-ads to let Jacksum scan for NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
      during recursively directory traversal on Microsoft Windows
    - added option called --scan-all-unix-file-types to let Jacksum scan for all Unix file types
    - added option called --bom for adding a Byte-Order Mark (BOM) to the output if a charset has been specified where a BOM
      is optional (charsets GB18030, UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-32BE)
    - added option -q file:<file> (GitHub issue #12)
    - added z-base-32 encoding for hash value representation

- minor improvements:

    - improved check mode statistics: added number of improperly lines, and number of ignored lines
    - improved the style of the short help to see everything even on terminals with 24-rows
    - improved the manpage: added the hash function tools that are supported by BusyBox

- minor bug fixes:

    - fixed: don't follow symlinks to block devices, character devices, named pipes, sockets,
      or doors if -f (regular files only) has been set.
    - fixed: duplicate filenames in the checkfile leads to a misleading output,
      the latest duplicate filename in a checkfile should win, and all previous duplicate filenames should be ignored
    - fixed the manpage: PowerShell applet Get-FileHash has also RIPEMD160
