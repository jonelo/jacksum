Jacksum 3.3.0, TBD

- new features:

    - added option --threads-hashing to control the number of threads if multiple
      algorithms should run in parallel
    - added option --threads-reading to control the number of threads if multiple
      files should be read in parallel
    - added option --path-relative-to-entry
      (required for the integration at the Windows Explorer's SendTo-menu)
    - added option --filesize to control whether the file size should be added or not

- performance:

    - the option --threads-reading is set to 1 by default to avoid performance degration
      for hashing files stored on non-SSD-media such as HDDs or CD-ROMs

- bug fixes:

    - fixed: option --path-relative-to is not taken into account if --compat has been set
    - fixed: if a path cannot be relativized by --path-relative-to it should not print
      stacktrace, but simply return the non-relativized path (e.g. if both paths have a different roots
      on Microsoft Windows).
    - fixed: normalize paths if --path-relative-to is set to avoid false positives during verification
    - fixed: if ")" is part of a file name (e.g. "file (1).txt", the regexp in the bsd, solaris-tagged,
      solaris-untagged, and openssl compat files don't detect the filename
    - fixed: if Jacksum is being called by its API, the invocation args should be printed
      from the actual parameter object values, and not from the CLI parameters
    - fixed: wrong help section is printed out in case of user errors with --file-list-format
    - fix: --header's invocation arg need to be quoted if arg starts with a # sign
