Jacksum 3.2.0, TBD

- new features

    - the default parser takes option -s into account (GitHub issue #9)
    - added option --header
    - added --path-relative-to to print paths relative to another path
      (required for the File Browser Integration on Windows)
    - added --path-absolute to print absolute paths
    - added --no-path to omit the path
    - added encodings base64-nopadding, and base64url-nopadding
    - added aliases rg32, rg-32, and rg64, rg-64 for radiogatun (GitHub issue #14)

- performance improvements

    - since Java 9+ supports a fast CRC32c, it became the primary implementation for crc32c


- bug fixes

    - fixed: on Linux during integrity checking, don't replace the back slash file separator for filenames,
      because on Linux it is allowed to have backslashes in filenames (GitHub issue #17)
    - fixed: Wrong hashSize in GNU-Crypto's whirlpool 0-arguments constructor
      (and all whirlpool derived implementations) (GitHub issue #19)
    - fixed: typo in manpage (bitwidth for RIPEMD 320)
