Jacksum 3.3.0, TBD

- new features:

    - added option --threads-hashing to control the number of threads if multiple
      algorithms should run in parallel
    - added option --threads-reading to control the number of threads if multiple
      files should be read in parallel

- performance:

    - by default the option --threads-reading is set to 1

- bug fixes:

    - fixed: option --path-relative-to is not taken into account if --compat has been set
    - fixed: wrong help section is printed out in case of user errors with --file-list-format
    - fixed: if Jacksum is being called by an API, the invocation args are printed
      from the actual parameter object values, and not from the CLI parameters
