    - added aliases rg32, rg-32, and rg64, rg-64 for radiogatun (GitHub issue #14)

- performance improvements

    - since Java 9+ supports a fast CRC32c, it became the primary implementation for crc32c


- bug fixes

    - fixed: on Linux during integrity checking, don't replace the back slash file separator for filenames,
      because on Linux it is allowed to have backslashes in filenames (GitHub issue #17)
    - fixed: Wrong hashSize in GNU-Crypto's whirlpool 0-arguments constructor
      (and all whirlpool derived implementations) (GitHub issue #19)
    - fixed: typo in manpage (bitwidth for RIPEMD 320)
