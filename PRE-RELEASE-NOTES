Jacksum 3.1.0, TBD

- new features:

    - added option --bom for adding a Byte-Order Mark (BOM) to the output if a charset
      has been specified where a BOM is optional (charsets GB18030, UTF-8, UTF-16BE,
      UTF-16LE, UTF-32LE, and UTF-32BE)
    - added option --unlock-all-unix-file-types to read from all file types on Unix-like
      operating systems including block devices which now allows to get a single hash from
      an entire disk or a partition for example.
    - added option --unlock-all-windows-file-types to allow Jacksum to read from all files types
      on Microsoft Windows including NTFS Alternate Data Streams, entire disks, and partitions
    - added option -q file:<file> (GitHub issue #12)
    - added z-base-32 encoding for hash value representation
    - added number of improperly lines, and ignored lines to the statistics of the check mode

- improvements:

    - improved the manpage
          o fixed: PowerShell applet Get-FileHash has also RIPEMD160
          o added the hash function tools that are supported by BusyBox
    - improved the style of the short help to see everything even on terminals with 24-rows

- fixes:

    - fixed: duplicate filenames in the checkfile leads to a misleading output,
      the latest duplicate filename in a checkfile should win, and all previous duplicate filenames should be ignored
