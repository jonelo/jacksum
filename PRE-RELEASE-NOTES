Jacksum 3.3.0, TBD

- new features:

    - added option --threads-hashing to control the number of threads if multiple
      algorithms should run in parallel
    - added option --threads-reading to control the number of threads if multiple
      files should be read in parallel

- performance:

    - by default the option --threads-reading is set to 1, except on macOS,
      where the value is set to "max" (since modern Macs do all have SSDs)

- bug fixes:

    - fixed: option --path-relative-to is not taken into account if --compat has been set
