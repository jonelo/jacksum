Jacksum 3.4.0, TBD

- new features:

    - added option -w resp. --wanted-list to find files that match hashes in a precalculated list
    - added option --wanted-list-charset and --charset-wanted-list to specify the charset for
      the "wanted list"-file
    - added option --wanted-list-filter in order to filter the output produced by -w,
      allows both positive and negative matching
    - documented operating modes to the help file

- performance:

- bug fixes:
    - sm3 not returned by calling "jacksum -a all -l"
    - if "--file-list <list>" and "--format #FILENAME{path}" is set, a NPE is thrown if the parent of a file in the list is null
    - false positives during -c: files are found as NEW more than once if the specified file references have different relative paths
      to the same file
