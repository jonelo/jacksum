Jacksum 3.5.0, TBD

- new features:
  - added CRC-82/DARC with aliases crc82, crc82_darc, crc-82, crc-82_darc.
  - improved --info for CRCs:
    - added the polynomial representations: normal, reversed, and Koopman
    - added the reciprocal polynomial for CRCs
    - added binary and hex for each poly representation
    - added polynomial representations and CRC parameters also for optimized CRC implementations
  - added sum64

- updates:
  - improved documentation
  - updated the crc-catalogue for the CRC finder with CRC-8/HITAG, CRC-16/M17, and CRC-32/MEF

- bug fixes:
  - updated serialversionUID in the Parameters class, because members have changed in Jacksum 3.4.0
