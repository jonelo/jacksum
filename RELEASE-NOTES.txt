Jacksum 3.8.0, TBD

- new features:
  - new algorithms
    - Jacksum now supports 513 algorithms!
    - added Romulus-H v1.3, it is one of the finalists from the Lightweight Cryptography Competition held by NIST
    - added 5 (resp. 17) algorithms from the round 2 of the NIST SHA-3 competition:
      - BlueMidnightWish-[224,256,384,512]
      - SIMD-[224,256,384,512]
      - CubeHash-[224,256,384,512]
      - Hamsi-[224,256,384,512]
      - Shabal-[192,224,256,384,512]
    - added CRC-64 (NVM Express 64b CRC)
    - added CRC-32 (Go Koopman) (issue #35)
  - added new options: --ignore-hashes, --ignore-sizes, --ignore-timestamps
  - added new styles (for I/O)
    - hash data base (hdb) style which is used by ClamAV's sigtool
    - full, full-nohashes, sizes+names, timestamps+names
  - added strict check mode
    - in strict check mode, all files must pass the verification process, and no files have been added, and no files have been removed
    - added strict check output to the verification summary
    - exit code follows --strict-check
  - added more algorithm investigation info
    - added avalanche effect info to the algorithm info
    - allowed option -q to specify the sequence for the avalanche calculation
    - added also reversed and Koopman representations for the reciprocal polynomial representation if --info is set for a CRC
  - added troubleshooting features
    - added Java Heap Info if --info option has been set
  - improvements on existing features
    - allowed option -e for --string-list

- bug fixes:
  - HMAC does not implement reset() method correctly which means that the same hash of the first calculation is always returned
  - Don't ignore records with same comments in wanted list files.
    While ignoring duplicate file names in check files makes sense for the option --check-file, that setting is
    suboptimal if option --wanted-list is used, because filenames are treated as comments in wanted lists.
  - OOM can occur if producer is much faster than the consumer threads
  - keccak-384 was not recognised as an alias
  - the prompt is "Password: " twice if both options -k password -q password have been specified
    (e.g. "jacksum -q password -a hmac:sha256 -k password"), the prompt for the key is now "Key (echo off): " to
    distinguish the input.
  - issue #32 --header not working using --quick
  - if multiple algorithms have been selected and file size is not wanted, Jacksum does not find valid entries
  - a few CRC algorithms (e.g. fcs16, fcs32, crc32c, crc32_mpeg2, crc64) do not print the Jacksum CRC definition code
    if --info has been requested
  - issue #36 - If multiple algorithms have been selected and file size is not wanted, Jacksum does not find valid entries
  - issue #37 - Parser does not find valid entries if algorithm "none" (no hashing) has been selected

- improved performance:
  - used a short buffer for the --header output

- updated documentation:
  - added info about the usage of the internal state value for verification of test vectors submitted for the NIST competition
    in the manpage for skein-256.
  - added the "Go API" to the compatibility lists


Jacksum 3.7.0, Aug 26, 2023

- new features:
  - added HMAC support
    - extended option -a to understand HMAC definitions, including optional truncations
    - added option -k, and alias --key to specify the secret for HMACs
    - added option --hmacs to print all hash functions that work with HMAC
    - allowed option --info for gathering HMAC info to print HMAC parameters such as
      - the underlying cryptographic hash
      - a specified truncation in both bits and bytes
      - how many bits a truncated length should have at least
      - whether a specified truncated length follows the RFC recommendation
      - how many bytes a specified key should have at least
      - whether the specified key follows the RFC recommendation wrt key length
      - whether the specified key will be hashed
  - added string hashing support
    - added option --string-list to calculate hash values from strings stored in text files
    - added options --string-list-charset, and alias --charset-string-list

  - added option --output-file-replace-tokens

- bug fixes:
  - NPE if filename is null and -F is set (e.g. 'jacksum -a none -F "#SEQUENCE" -q txt:')
  - NPE can occur if both -a none and -E without -F have been set
  - #FILENAME is not replaced in <format> if both "-F <format>" and "-q file:<file>" have been used
  - aliases blake2sp-256 and blake2bp-512 are not accessible
  - regression: "jacksum -a all:blake -l" returns "blake2sp-256 is an unknown algorithm" due to missing alias
  - crc32_mpeg2 didn't reveal the poly representations by specifying --info

- improved performance:
  - performance for algorithm info output (-a <algos> [--list] --info)

- updated documentation:
  - added description and encoding tables for the most common encodings (see "jacksum -h -E")

    - PRNG hash
    - AST strsum PRNG hash
  - alternate implementation for blake3 provided by bouncy castle, the existing primary implementation still remains the
    primary, because it is slightly faster.

  - updated bundled bouncycastle version to 1.71 (digests only), but baked out the regression that was
    introduced by issue # 1036 in the Kangaroo class (the constructor parameter is now ignored completely
    in bouncy castle :-/)

- bug fixes:
  - github issue #22: Statistics are all zero if --check-line has been set
  - github issue #24: Regression: Jacksum 3.0.0 to 3.4.0 hangs while trying to read NTUSER.DAT on Microsoft Windows

    - documented operating modes to the help file

- bug fixes:
    - sm3 not returned by calling "jacksum -a all -l"
    - if "--file-list <list>" and "--format #FILENAME{path}" is set, a NPE is thrown if the parent of a file in the list is null

    - added public API calls to allow requesting info from the build-in help

- performance:

    - the option --threads-reading is set to 1 by default to avoid performance degradation
      for hashing files stored on non-SSD-media such as HDDs or CD-ROMs
    - faster output of the build-in help by using memory buffering before printing
    - improved initial values for HashMap constructors

- bug fixes:

    - fixed: if ")" is part of a file name (e.g. "file (1).txt", the regexp in the bsd, solaris-tagged,
      solaris-untagged, and openssl compat files don't detect the filename
    - fixed: if a path cannot be relativized by --path-relative-to it should not print
      stacktrace, but simply return the non-relativized path (e.g. if both paths have a different roots

    - you can limit the depth of the recursion by specifying a depth
    - added -L in order read files from a predefined list
    - in addition to the "Rocksoft (tm) Model CRC Algorithm" schema,
      the Generic CRC can be parameterized to include the (optional xor'ed)
      length to the CRC in order to describe algorithms such as the POSIX
      cksum or the FDDI CRC
    - extended option -V in order to print out details of algorithms
      (e.g. polynomial as a math expression for all CRCs)
	- improved option -V to enable/disable errors as well	
    - each dash-option has got a dash-dash-option as well
    - added the double dash-option in order to signify the end of command options  
    - added --info option to get info about the program, for the selected algorithms or
      the compatibility file
    - added options --charset-check-file, --charset-file-list, --charset-error-file,
      --charset-output-file, --charset-stdout, and --charset-stderr in order to specify
	  the charset for various I/O objects
    - Shortcut option -8 or --utf8 can be used to set UTF-8 character set for both stdout and stderr

- Internal/API

  new features and improvements
    - feature request sf# 1602248: support for NIO byte buffers,
      Thanks to Moritz Ringler, Germany for the feature request
    - the code structure has been significantly redesigned and refactored

      implemenation from www.dnsjava.org (2-clause BSD license)


- Compatibility changes

  changes
    - requires a JRE/JDK that is compatible with Java 11 or later, OpenJDK 11+ is recommended
    - released under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 or later
    - the default algorithm is now SHA3-256 and not SHA-1 anymore  
    - by default, data is read from standard input in binary mode
    - by default, recursively operation is active for folders, by default depth is unlimited
    - if -r is specified explicitly, also a depth has to be specified
    - redirection to a file by -u, -U, -o, and -O uses UTF-8 rather than the default
      shell character set in order to support Unicode characters for filenames/folders
      Thanks to Rajmund, UK for the feature request and code suggestion
    - option -l enables the list view in general, for filtering verification results use --list-filter
	- option "-t default" defaults to a format that also includes the milliseconds
	
  deletions
    - options -m, -p, -S, -w have been removed
    - the Jacksum class in the default package has been removed
    - Java version check has been removed
    - German translation for option -h has been removed (at least for now)	


Jacksum 1.7.0, July 30, 2006
- added a customizable CRC algorithm, now you can calculate any CRC which
  can be described by the Rocksoft Model CRC Algorithm (8 to 64 bit width),
  see also sf# 1518023 Setting of an initial value for a CRC
- support for combinable checksums, see also sf# 1210489
  (multiple hashes at the same time), thanks to synonymous2 for this feature request
- support for using all algorithms at once (-a all)
- two new algorithms are supported: crc32_bzip2, HAS-160
- support for Tiger Tree hashes (aka Merkle Hashes). Thanks to Carsten Krüger,
  Germany for the feature request and pointers to some resources
- support for new encodings (bin, dec, oct)
- support for the combination of both options -c and -w,
  Thanks to Dipl.-Inf. (FH) Ralf Kahrl, Germany for the implementation of this feature
- a small performance improvement for the whirlpool algorithms
- replaced the crc24 with a faster one by using the customizable CRC algorithm
  (the old one had also a minor bug in the parameterless constructor)
- bug fixed: -V summary does not always return reasonable values
- bug fixed: update(byte[], int, int) fails if offset is > 0 (sf # 1525183)
  This can cause problems if Jacksum is incorporated in different projects
- The bouncycastle and gnu classes have been moved to jonelo.jacksum.adapt so that
  they won't clash with different downloaded versions of the classes. Actually this
  is to avoid potential problems if a project uses both bouncycastle and Jacksum for example.
  Thanks to Alberto Rodriguez, Spain for the feature request
- documentation updated (BeOS' data integrity programs, Tru64 and year of the invention for
  many algorithms)

- improved option -h: can show only fractions of the help file rather than
  the complete help file
- improved option -t: #SEPARATOR and #QUOTE are also replaced
  Thanks to Claudio C., Italy for the feature request
- improved option -F: #FILENAME{NAME} and #FILENAME{PATH} can be used
  Thanks to Claudio C., Italy for the feature request
