  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
  making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
  combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
  you permission to link this library with independent modules to
  produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
  independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
  executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
  for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
  license of that module.  An independent module is a module which is
  not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this
  library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
  library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to
  do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
